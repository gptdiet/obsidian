The GSI [OpenSearch k-NN plugin](https://www.gsitechnology.com/OpenSearch) also addresses one of the key limitations of OpenSearch — namely it’s lack of pre-filter support for nearest neighbor vector search. Pre-filtering on metadata is a common requirement in search applications. For example, product metadata such as item description, item title, category, and brand, are often used as pre-filters to a search query.
